# Langlo

Language Grammar Coach is a private two-learner grammar app planned for French A1, German A1/A2 and English A1/A2. This repository currently contains the local application foundation, not a completed curriculum or pilot release.

## Local setup

Use Node 24.19.0 and npm 11.9.0. Run npm ci, npm run check, npm run lint, npm run format:check, npm test, npm run test:property, npm run build and npm run test:e2e. Install test Chromium with npx playwright install --with-deps chromium on an ordinary development machine. A preinstalled browser can be selected with PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH.

Start local development with npm run dev. Start the built Node server with HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=3000 npm start. Copy .env.example only for local settings; no secrets are needed for this foundation. Production hosting, TLS, reverse-proxy settings and migrations are separate release work.

The fixture harness uses POSIX filesystem permissions and is verified on Linux. Tests use synthetic accounts and disposable file-backed libSQL databases. Fixture tools must refuse any network URL or non-fixture target. The production database is never needed to build or verify the foundation. Runtime database use, maintained authentication, curricula, assessment, AI fallback, SMTP recovery and Windows Anki delivery are pending.

## Boundaries and evidence

See docs/bootstrap.md, docs/bootstrap-tasks.md, docs/routes.md, docs/environment.md, docs/schema.md, docs/testing-invariants.md and docs/evidence/T006.md through T009.md for exact results and limits. Liveness is separate from readiness; a running server is not a working product. The Windows loopback spike requires a separately authorized device.

## Source provenance and license

The setup follows App-Bootstrap-ADM at b658231eb20d8920a538ac355a4563c1e4c53096: https://github.com/Bonobo791/App-Bootstrap-ADM/tree/b658231eb20d8920a538ac355a4563c1e4c53096. It is guidance and templates, not an app scaffold. No Moderaty application source, branding, credentials or learner records were copied. BOOTSTRAP-LICENSE preserves attribution for the source guidance.

The Langlo license is pending the owner’s choice. package.json remains UNLICENSED and private until that decision. The intended GitHub destination is Bonobo791/Langlo; no remote publication or deployment is implied by this local work.
