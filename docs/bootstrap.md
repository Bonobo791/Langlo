# Bootstrap status

## Project decisions

- Project: Langlo / Language Grammar Coach; private two-learner pilot, full five language-level curricula and reviewed Windows Anki delivery remain the product goal
- Current slice: T006–T009 neutral scaffold, executable quality harness, safe runtime/error boundaries and isolated durable schema
- Profile: server application; SvelteKit 3.0.1, Svelte 5.57.2, TypeScript 6.0.3, Vite 8.3.3, Node adapter 6.0.0
- Runtime/manager: Node 24.19.0 and npm 11.9.0, one exact lockfile
- Isolation: newly initialized local repository on dev, separate from existing apps; intended origin Bonobo791/Langlo; no remote write
- Selected eventual providers: dedicated Turso/libSQL with Drizzle, bounded OpenAI fallback, Proton SMTP, Coolify hosting and Netlify-managed DNS; none connected or exercised in this slice
- Current storage: actual disposable local file-backed libSQL; only synthetic identities and records
- Current UI: original responsive public foundation shell; private routes deny access before auth is implemented
- Production/external-write limits: no credentials, live calls, spending, real accounts, SSH, DNS, desktop, deployment or production DB access
- Public source: repository destination identified; license decision and publication remain pending

## Compatibility ruling

The plan requested svelte.config.js and a generated .svelte-kit tsconfig. Current stable Kit 3 requires configuration in vite.config.ts and tsconfig extending $app/tsconfig; hook types come from @sveltejs/kit/hooks. This slice follows the current supported contracts. Private variables use explicit dynamic src/env.ts declarations and $app/env/private. No deprecated config file is supplied. Cost if this ruling is wrong: framework downgrade/migration before later features, with no user data involved.

Official compatibility was checked against package registry metadata and the framework docs on 2026-10-06. Sources: https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node, https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/environment-variables, https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/server-only-modules. The setup guidance is pinned at App-Bootstrap-ADM b658231eb20d8920a538ac355a4563c1e4c53096; that repository contains guidance/templates, not the application.

## Requirement status

Exact setup contracts and evidence are expanded in bootstrap-tasks.md. Final local verification: check has zero errors/warnings; lint/format pass; 62 ordinary tests, three default properties and eight built HTTP checks pass; the Node build passes. A fresh local clone with npm ci kept the lockfile unchanged and passed all 62 tests/check/build. See docs/evidence/verification.json. Browser rendering and remote CI remain open.

## Readiness

Independent next work can build maintained auth/provisioning, owner-scoped operations and the versioned content importer on this foundation. Full curricula still require source audit and checked original content. Provider configuration and paid fallback require separate budget/access choices. Windows loopback feasibility needs an authorized Windows device. Local schema tests do not establish those outcomes.

This executor’s Chromium launch fails on restricted local IPC sockets even with the supported sandbox escalation. The cloud browser also rejects local loopback navigation. Built-server HTTP checks can run here, while rendered desktop/mobile screenshots and full npm run test:e2e must be verified in a suitable authorized environment before T007/browser acceptance is complete.
